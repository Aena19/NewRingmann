    <p class="h6">SIGMA EXCEL</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="desc">Sigma Excel rings feature a tapered contact area and a smooth, polished surface that helps to reduce yarn breakage and improve yarn quality. The surface finish is such that they help to reduce friction and improve spinning efficiency.</p>
    <p class="desc">The combination of these features makes Sigma Excel rings particularly well-suited for high-speed ring spinning applications, where minimizing yarn breakage and improving yarn quality is critical to maintaining productivity and profitability. Sigma Excel rings are available in a range of sizes to suit different spinning applications, and they are designed to be compatible with a wide range of spinning machines.</p>
    <p class="desc">By choosing Sigma Excel rings, textile manufacturers can improve the performance and efficiency of their spinning operations, reduce downtime and maintenance costs, and produce high-quality yarn with fewer defects and less waste.</p>

    <p class="h6">EXCEL</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="desc">Excel rings are another type of spinning ring manufactured by Ringmann. These rings are designed to provide superior performance in high-speed ring spinning applications. Excel rings are made from a special steel alloy that is highly durable and wear-resistant, and they are designed to withstand the high speeds and stresses associated with modern ring spinning machines.</p>
    <p class="desc">One of the key features of Excel rings is their unique surface finish that help to reduce friction and improve yarn quality. This surface finish also helps to reduce the accumulation of dust and lint on the ring, which can help to minimize yarn breaks and improve spinning efficiency.</p>
    <p class="desc">Excel rings are available in a variety of sizes to suit different spinning applications, and they are designed to be compatible with a wide range of spinning machines. By choosing Excel rings, textile manufacturers can improve the quality and consistency of their yarn, reduce downtime and maintenance costs, and increase the efficiency and profitability of their spinning operations.</p>
